# CommunityConnect

##Inspiration
Natural disasters are devastating and lead to the displacement of thousands of people. One of the biggest challenges during these times is streamlining the communication between people to help make the search process a lot more effective and efficient. We particularly found inspiration from Hurricane Katrina which resulted in 1500 missing people at the time, and of that, 705 people are still missing to this day. This is why we created Community Connect, which aims to create a community driven platform that helps locate missing people during natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina which could have drastically improved the process

##What it does
It allows users to upload reports of missing people. The report includes geolocation, image and description. If a member of the community has seen the person they can proceed to respond to the report. 

##Challenges
It was difficult to connect the backend database to place markers on to the Google Map. 

##Accomplishments
We are proud of the new collaboration skills that allowed us to finish the project efficiently.

##What I learned
We learned how to work with backend technologies and the Google Map API for the first time. We also continued to improve our application of HTML and CSS.

##Whatâ€™s next
We want to develop a mobile application to make the process even more convenient and efficient.
